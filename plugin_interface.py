"""
Extends Yapsy IPlugin interface to pass information about the board to plugins.

Fields of interest for plugins:
  args: list of arguments passed to the plugins
  sample_rate: actual sample rate of the board
  eeg_channels: number of EEG
  aux_channels: number of AUX channels
  
If needed, plugins that need to report an error can set self.is_activated to False during activate() call.

NB: because of how yapsy discovery system works, plugins must use the following syntax to inherit to use polymorphism (see http://yapsy.sourceforge.net/Advices.html):

    import plugin_interface as plugintypes

    class PluginExample(plugintypes.IPluginExtended):
